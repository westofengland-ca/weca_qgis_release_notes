# WECA QGIS file release notes
üìç üåê üåç üìà

Geographical data across the Combined Authority is viewable by staff using 'QGIS' software. A QGIS file exists with various map layers pre-loaded.
To explore our GIS data, navigate to [this folder](https://westofenglandca.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GIS/Shared%20Documents/General/QGIS_map_file), then ***download a copy of the `.qgz` file into your personal documents and rename the file***. Please rename the copied file by adding your name and surname initial to the end (eg. `WECA_GIS_v08_TheoF.qgz`). When opening the file, please allow **2 minutes** for QGIS to fully load the layers.

Release notes are available below for the latest QGIS `.qgz` file. New releases expected every couple of months. Check the folder linked above for updated versions.

Training material can be found [here](https://westofenglandca.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GIS/Shared%20Documents/General/Training).
GIS catchup recording demos can be found [here](https://westofenglandca.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GIS/Shared%20Documents/General/Catch-ups/Recordings).
